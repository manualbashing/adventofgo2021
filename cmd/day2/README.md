## Day 2 Lessons learned

[Day 2 - Advent of Code 2021: Dive!](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2)

## Part 1

I figured that the go file is not executable if the package is not declared as `main` but as any other thing, like `day2`. Need to read this: [Packages — An Introduction to Programming in Go | Go Resources (golang-book.com)](https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro/11)

This time I also understood the difference between using `=` and `:=` in a variable assignment. (The latter infers the type.) I like that!

I had to look up how to split a string on a whitespace character. Easy peasy with help of this: [3 ways to split a string into a slice · YourBasic Go](https://yourbasic.org/golang/split-string-into-slice/)

A little bit of googling was also necessary to figure out, how multidimensional arrays are declared in Go: [Go - Multidimensional Arrays in Go (tutorialspoint.com)](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/go/go_multi_dimensional_arrays.htm)

So far I like Go's syntax. It feels very intuitive.
